        <p>
          Emotional intelligence generally is defined as ones ability to 
          understand/perceive their own emotions and others around them. 
          This means that ones ability to manage their own and others emotions 
          to empathise, communicate, and overcome challenges and conflicts.
        </p>
        

        <h1 class="post-title-long">How is it different to IQ?</h1>
        <p>
          IQ is an intelligence quotent which is the total score of someones 
          IQ derived from a set of standard tests or subtests designed to assess 
          human intelligence. The distribution of scores is a normal distribution.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Why is it important?</h1>
        <p>
          It has been argued that EQ is more important than IQ, and good example 
          is than with the highest IQ in America works as a bouncer. But hey, it 
          may be that having the highest IQ you worked out that being a bouncer 
          is the best lifestyle for you and there's absolutely nothing wrong with 
          choosing a profession, and I’m not in a position or in a habit of judging
           others life choices - I’d hate someone putting the same lens on me! 
           EQ I believe is more important if you’re in a role where you're 
           communication and collaboration with others matters, in some industries 
           such as structural engineering or a scientist like my father where your 
           work is primarily siloed with minimal conflict and that works fine - 
           for the most part. For I’d say about 90% of roles your EQ is going to 
           be more important. My manager at my old work although he often 
           proclaimed he wasn’t the strongest in term of technical skills he had a 
           strong sense of EQ and was able to communicate with others who had 
           stronger skills, listen and understand and ask the right questions to 
           fully understand/relate. His EQ additionally put him in the position of 
           team leader while he was only 28 meaning he moved to being a full 
           manager while in his early 30’s. When you feel like someone respects 
           you, is listening and has made an effort to empathize with you, you’re 
           more willing to perform. Whereas if you don’t feel respected, listened 
           to or like your emotions or perspective matter you’re motivation drops 
           and resentment builds.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            IQ is more important for roles where you can’t rely on anyone else 
            for help, maybe you’re a technical director, startup founder and 
            there's a new task that no one in your team knows how to complete, 
            you’ll likely have to rely on your own abilities to solve the problem. 
            But in most cases you’ll be able to find someone to learn from.
