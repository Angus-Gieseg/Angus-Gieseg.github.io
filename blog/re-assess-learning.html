        <p>
          I’ve always had a problem for solving problems, being creative and having the freedom to think and work amongst a 
          team. I’ve tried a lot of things after leaving high school, I studied structural Engineering, did a year and a half 
          of business specialising is entrepreneurship, tried building two startups and still work on one of them. Heck, I 
          even launched a homebrewing society which we grew to 280 members renewing on an annual basis. The satisfaction/ 
          reward I got from those experiences was building a culture with others, learning new skills and venturing into the 
          unknown. I decided to take this course because I was frustrated with having very little understanding of the technical 
          requirements of our tourism tech startup and reviewing or roadmap and setting realistic deadlines. Although I’m five 
          weeks in its made communicating with my team and much easier. The biggest joy I’ve got out of this course is I’ve 
          found a passion for backend coding and programing which builds on my previous skills building machine learning models.
           My long term career was to build structural engineering software solution but now, It’s anything within the realm of 
           technology, I feel natural coding and defining communicating visions. Thus, I want to pursue a role as a product 
           manager and to get there join and work under a product focused tech company, experiencing it for myself. Then work 
           my way up to a true product manager and set a vision with clients or customers and work with a team to develop the 
           best solution possible.
           
           Going into bootcamp I still dont feel confident as a front end developer and my strength will be logic / mathamatical challenges. 
           Working remotely as a pair will be challenging and a good learning experience, I will need to put extra effort into finding 
           efficient ways to communicate and QA other work.
           Communication will be extremely important and empathising with my partner who may be more or less experience / confident 
           as me. All I expect from my team is to show up, and be present, I don’t expect someone to be at the same level as my with 
           everything nor do I expect to be at the same level as others with front end development.
           For myself I expect to be o be clear and empathic with my partners/ team. Be mindful of not coming across rude or 
           blunt when I’m focusing on a problem and saying “Hold up, give me a few minutes I’m thinking of something instead of 
           trying to talk while solving problems” I struggle to focus on more than two things at once, and often find people try 
           to talk while solving problems and I don’t work efficiently in that way.
