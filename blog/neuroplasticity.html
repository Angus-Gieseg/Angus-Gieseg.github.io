        <h1 class="post-title-long">Neuroplasticity - Sentis </h1>
        <p>
          The main take-aways from this video was that our brain is not static, the old-age 
          concept that when your younger is the only time you can learn, and that your abilities
          and skills are tied to your intellect.

        <p>
          The best drive to increase your neuroplasticity is done through behavior - strong habits, 
          mindset towards focusing and embracing challenges. Its highly variable. Consistent practice 
          and doing the work will make you learn faster, if you struggle or feel uncomfortable there 
          is greater learning. Its shaped both by what you choose to do and what you don't choose. 
          There are certain genetic characteristics that help learning in different styles for 
          different content.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">How to I will increase my own neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
          Equiped with the knowledge of how Neuroplasticity can be shaped to my own benefits, I have made an effort to reduce
          my time spent procrastinating and more time learning. This is to build pathways to learn over procrastinate.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Growth Mindset takeaways</h1>
        <p>
          The final video is from Carol Dweck who was influential in the development in the "growth mindset and
          even wrote a book. I found it very relatable when Carol discussed giving false praise to students. I've been told I'm smart
          or gifted and it really de-motivated me or put an awkward amount of pressure on me which made me risk adverse in highschool.
          As an adult I'm far less reliant on validation from peers so I would kindly thank praise but know I still needed to do better,
          this reinforced this belief to work hard.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">How I will update my learning strategy</h1>
        <p>
          These new learnings will influence my learning plan by seeking out difficult task to increase my focus, If I get comfortable and find things easy
          I need to somehow challenge myself to make tasks harder by addition of addition improvements if my timebox allows.
