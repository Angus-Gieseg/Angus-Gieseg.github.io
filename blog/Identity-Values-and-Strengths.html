  <h2 class = "spacing"> Identity, Values, and Strengths </h2>
  <h3> Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
    Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
    and how you reflect on the decision now. </h3>
  <p class="spacing"> At my previous work we had a culture of "she'll be right"
    when designing some structural elements such as beams and columns. The "she'll be right" 
    I precieved is called the "engineering judgement". When someone has years of experience
    the usually don't need to do all the nitty gritty calculations, but if someones lazy 
    and over confident this could lead to real issues. This scared the hell out of me as a 
    fresh graduate. I talked with my manager and discussed designing a SMATH sheet to automatically size beams
    to replace the outdated spreadsheets they were using. I identified through previous jobs
    it was easier for an engineerer to review the code for an SMATH sheet to check the assumptions
    and formulas over using an excel spreadsheet which are inherently hard to reverse engineer.
    The project took me a full week to build and QA with the technical director, what I later
    found out was Engineers often guess sizes of beams and end up over-engineering the sizes 
    so in the end it usually works out fine. Only a few of the engineers ended up using the 
    new SMATH sheet while others preferred to rely on their "engineering judgement".

  <h3> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </h3>
    <p class="spacing"> The culture had its pro's and con's like many places, we had a great
      manager who showed an interest working with the team and building mutual respect.
      Given ownership of projects much earlier than working at other firms and they made and 
      effort to have social events with the team. The downside was how overworked the team was
      with little collaberation. The teams were siloed and followed a waterfall approach to project
      management. If I was to stay a structural Engineer in NZ they would probably still be 
      one of the best places to work at. I was incredibly thankful for the support and time 
      invested in me, primarily by the technical director. The technical director encouraged 
      me to feed my curiousity and grow a confidence in being diligent about in design and verification.

      Additionally our manager saw I had a knack for learning new things and was able to become
      familiar with SMATH quickly(Engineering Design Software) which meant I designed a variety of 
      complex design packages for different structural elements.

  <h3> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey? </h3>
    <p class="spacing"> My strengths are analytical thinking and breaking down problems into bite sized
      chunks. As the technical director at my work said "How do you eat an elephant, one bite at a time"
    </p>
  <h3> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance 
    or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on 
    what other strategies you would try now and why. </h3>
    <p class="spacing"> Most recently there has been tension within my Univeristy group project. I chose to
      take the role of Structural Engineer which is has the highest workload compared to 3 waters and infrastructure.
      I initially didn't want to take the position as I was already working fulltime and still work in a startup.
      I saw the rest of the team didn't feel confident and so I volunteered as I had experience already doing similar
      work outside of University. This meant I could lead by example and had some weight to delegate additional work
      between the team. The issue that arose was the geotechnical engineer already had far more work than the waste wate engineer
      and they both needed to do discuss in their reports ecological & archaeological implications. We made 
      a compromise during a meeting to have the waste water engineer complete a more detailed report that the geotechnical
      engineer could pull from. Being a third party between the two meeting I had no vested interest other than getting
      the work complete in a timely manner which I believe helped us reach a conclusion around the work expectations 
      and deadlines.
