        <h1 class="post-title-long">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. 
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
          and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>
        
        <p>
          At my previous work we had a culture of "she'll be right"
          when designing some structural elements such as beams and columns. The "she'll be right" 
          I precieved is called the "engineering judgement". When someone has years of experience
          the usually don't need to do all the nitty gritty calculations, but if someones lazy 
          and over confident this could lead to real issues. This scared the hell out of me as a 
          fresh graduate. I talked with my manager and discussed designing a SMATH sheet to automatically size beams
          to replace the outdated spreadsheets they were using. I identified through previous jobs
          it was easier for an engineerer to review the code for an SMATH sheet to check the assumptions
          and formulas over using an excel spreadsheet which are inherently hard to reverse engineer.
          The project took me a full week to build and QA with the technical director, what I later
          found out was Engineers often guess sizes of beams and end up over-engineering the sizes 
          so in the end it usually works out fine. Only a few of the engineers ended up using the 
          new SMATH sheet while others preferred to rely on their "engineering judgement".

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Describe how your culture and the people around you have 
          influenced your values and identity.</h1>
        <p>
          My family always encouraged us to form our own opinions on topics and were naturally very direct
          which I believe meant we had a clearer idea of the hard parts of life. Growing up Christian, which
          I guess is cultural too, has in-grained a drive to be honest, and open and strive to walk into a room 
          and love other for where and who they are. I've connected with my iwi midway through Highschool and I found it
          super interesting and refreshing connecting with my whakapapa. Theres still a lot of backroom division between
          european culture and values and Maori. I believe New Zealand has a great opportunity and is heading towards and 
          intersection between the two cultures and I hope to one day figure out my part in that journey.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey..</h1>
        <p>
          My strengths are my analytical right brain skills, I'm natural drawn towards logical program vs design and styling.
          I naturally love to get curious and really want to learn about the possible technologies available to make better products
          which lead into my ambitious to be a product manager. 
          
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. 
          How might these affect your learning journey?</h1>
        <p>
          My limitations are styling, and writting. I personaly waste a large amount of time figitting with styling, and have
          found the processes of getting things to line up frustrating and not as rewarding as Javascript. I'd additionally assume
          I'll be slower than my peer when it comes to writting content for the blog.         
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance 
          or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on 
          what other strategies you would try now and why. </h1>
        <p>
          Most recently there has been tension within my Univeristy group project. I chose to
          take the role of Structural Engineer which is has the highest workload compared to 3 waters and infrastructure.
          I initially didn't want to take the position as I was already working fulltime and still work in a startup.
          I saw the rest of the team didn't feel confident and so I volunteered as I had experience already doing similar
          work outside of University. This meant I could lead by example and had some weight to delegate additional work
          between the team. The issue that arose was the geotechnical engineer already had far more work than the waste wate engineer
          and they both needed to do discuss in their reports ecological & archaeological implications. We made 
          a compromise during a meeting to have the waste water engineer complete a more detailed report that the geotechnical
          engineer could pull from. Being a third party between the two meeting I had no vested interest other than getting
          the work complete in a timely manner which I believe helped us reach a conclusion around the work expectations 
          and deadlines.
