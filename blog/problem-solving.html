        <h1 class="post-title-long"> What are strong problem solving habits?</h1>
        
        <p>
          Firstly, what is problem solving? Problem solving is the the process of finding a solution to a complex problem. For some
          people this is throwing a handfull of darts at a board... blindfolded... until one lands a comfortable distance from the 
          bulls eye. It's often too large of a time investment to get a perfect bulls eye and in many cases its not economical or time
          efficient to solve the problem perfectly. For example you could spent hours rewritting your code to make it a 1/100 seconds faster,
          or add a feature which serves only 1% of your users needs so overall you've recieved a negligible improvement. What I'm going to discuss
          how to indetify a process to discover the best habits & mindset to solve a complex problem. 
        </p>
          
        <p>
          I'm going to use examples where I've become stuck and how I've overcome the challenge. The most important thing is to not get bogged down
          in the problem and feel like your inadequate and unable to progress. The number one take away should actually be to go and do your own
          research on the growth mindset and realise, that if you feel like your progressing slowly or fail to achieve a desired outcome, 
          you haven't failed, you're just not there yet.
        </p>
        
        
        <h1 class="post-title-long">Sometimes its the simple things..</h1>
        <p>
          Have you ever faced a problem that you poured hours of time into, only to find the problem to be quite simple?
          I have many times. The most common mistakes are spelling errors, and syntaxing(formatting of code) incorrectly. 
          Can you spot the two errors between the two examples of code where say the array1 = [1,2]?
        </p>

        <pre><code class = "language-html">
          for (i = 0; i < array1.length; i++ {
            consol.log("Hello World")
          }

          VS

          for (i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {
            console.log("Hello World")
          }
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          From the example the simple problem was that console.log was spelt incorrectly and the for loop end bracket was missing.
        </p>


          
        <h1 class="post-title-long">A problem I faced recently?</h1>
        <p>
          Recently I was using a .find method to identify which object contained the string "Scooby". The arrayOfObjects can be see below. 
        </p>
        <pre><code class = "language-html">
          arrayOfObjects = [{ doorNumber: 1, hiding: 'Shaggy'},
                            { doorNumber: 2, hiding: 'Scooby'}
                            { doorNumber: 3, hiding: 'The Monster!'}]

          - WRONG CODE BELOW -
          function whereaAreYou(arrayOfObjects){
            return arrayOfObjects.find(scoobs) => scoobs.name === "Scooby"
          }

          - CORRECT CODE BELOW - 
          function whereaAreYou(arrayOfObjects){
            return arrayOfObjects.find(scoobs) => scoobs.hiding === "Scooby"
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The issue I had was that I had found some example code to use .find method, and I thought, great! That's exactly the same use case
          and then... nothing, it didn't work. So I tried re-writting the arrow function as a regular fuction and still it didn't work. So, 
          I read the MDN documentation, we'll I skimned through to no avail. Finally I had to reachout for help, and the solution was painfully simple.
          The .find method used dot notation to identify the key to search through. I used ".name" when I needed ".hiding" which was giving me the error.
          Throughout the process I was incredibly frustrated and couldn't seem to make it work, something I felt was telling me I had been lazy in the way 
          I went about solving the problem and wasn't being diligent in my problem solving. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Through experience I identified where I went wrong. I rushed through and wan't diligent reading through example. When I'm faced with code I should
          not simply paste it in a alter it as I need, I should write out the code line by line and make sure I understand each function.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title">Problem Solving Techniques</h1>
        <p>
          In this section I'll be discussing and reflecting on different problem solving techniques.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Pseudocode</h1>
        <p>
          Pseudcoding is my favourite way to code for two reasons, It's fast and a good habit to help others reviewing my code. 
          Pseudcoding embodies the quote "How do you eat an elephant, one bite at a time" - My old manager. Pseudocoding is the process of adding 
          comments at the top of functions to layout all the tasks that need to be achieved for the required procedure to pass. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Rubber Ducky</h1>
        <p>
          The Rubber Ducky technique is the process of solving a problem through talking about it with a peer or to yourself. Sometimes putting your problem
          into words makes it easier to solve. I find it having varying success and most useful to identify gaps in my knowledge "If you can't explain something
          simply you don't understand it" -Albert Einstein.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Reading error messages</h1>
        <p>
          Thankfully the error messages help solve the most common mistakes such as incorrect syntaxing or using array functions for objects and vice versus.
          As I'm progressing I'm slowlying becoming more confident at reading error messages and recently discovered you can search on the web for the error and
          that often helps to solve the problem.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Console.logging</h1>
        <p>
          Console Logging is the technique I frequently use to check the input of functions and see how it is being passed through at each stage. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Console.logging</h1>
        <p>
          Googling, is usually the first step of problem solving, checking I understand how a function works and how others have used it to complete a similar task.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Asking others</h1>
        <p>
          Asking others works two fold, writting out the problem to others ties into rubber ducky technique and sometimes I solve it before I send the message through
          writting it out. Asking for help is a final resort as I believe the greatest learning is through struggling with something.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Improving the process to make one cohessive strategy </h1>
        <p>
          I believe the best process for me would be as follows;
          <ul>
            <ol>1. Pseudcoding to avoid making future errors and breaking down the problem</ol>
            <ol>2. Consolelogging at each stage to review the program is passing through</ol>
            <ol>3. Reading error messages</ol>
            <ol>4. Reviewing examples and documentation online around the task and error message</ol>
            <ol>5. Rubber ducky method with myself or peer</ol>
            <ol>5. Asking for help from supervisor</ol>
          </ul>
        </p>
