  <h2 class = "spacing"> Questions </h2>
  <h3> 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h3>
  <p class="spacing"> My long term career goal is to work in a high preforming product focused
    team. I've always loved designing, engineering and found a late passion
    for startups/business at University.
  </p>
  <h3> 2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
  </h3>
  <p class="spacing ">
    I've always preformed well in open ended projects I always found joy working
    through multi-facited problems. I've got a solid foundation in mathamatics
    and generally enjoy being under pressure and working in uncomfortable and new settings.
  </p>
  <p class="spacing">
    I have both ADHD and Dyslexia and always find myself going on tagents and
    sometimes getting sidetracked going down a rabbit hole of curiousity. 
    My worst habit developed while studying, I could always get away with 
    last minute studying and found techniques to learn content faster so 
    I could do things I enjoyed like learning python/Data-science and 
    startup competitions. It means If I'm not stressed or under pressure I 
    procrastinate which through this program I hope to overcome/ find routines to break it.
  </p>
  <h3 class="spacing"> 3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would 
    you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h3>
  <p class="spacing">
    Ability to focus/motivated myself when I'm not under pressure. I've built strong tenacity and ability to
    produce high quality work but unfortunately only when I'm under pressure.
  </p>
  <h3 class="spacing"> 4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
    This should include: </h3>
  <ul>
    <ol class="spacing"> - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
      Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    </ol>
    <ol class="spacing">- What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </ol>
  </ul>
  <p class="spacing">
    I find in group projects I'm always focused and commit to getting work done in a timely manner
    this is due to being a people pleaser and I'm pretty competitive and don't like not pulling
    my weight. To ensure I stay focused and complete work on time I will make sure I stay within
    my timebox. Motivation shouldn't be an issue in group projects as I always feel accountable.
    <br>
    <br>
    When things begin to buildup or I feel I'm going to become overloaded it would be good to 
    notify my facilitators before things get out of hand. Then map out the fastest way to complete
    the minimum requirement. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="spacing"> 5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely 
    way </h3>
  <p class="spacing">
    I really depends on the help I need currently If I become stuck I start by asking homegroup,
    then help requests, then finally facilators. If its not a technical questions and its assignemnt
    related then first I'll ask HG then facilitators. If its personal then straight to facilitators.
  </p>  
  <h3 class="spacing"> 6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
  <p class="spacing">
    As long as I'm within office hours I'd expect to be able to reach a facilitator within 30-1hr.
    understandably this may not always be possible if there are others needing help. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="spacing"> 7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed 
    to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important 
    to plan these in.</h3>
  <p class = "spacing">
    I only have two commitments currently which is Monday mornings 8am for a University group project
    meeting. Last term I was working 50hrs p/w and still managed to stay ontop of the project so 
    it shouldn't be an issues. I just have to be careful not to have deadlines clash and ensure I get onto
    work early, and not go down rabit holes doing more unnesscary work than I need to. 
  </p>
