        <h1 class="post-title-long">An Anology to describe the relationship between HTML and Javascript </h1>
        
        <p>
          Websites previously were built statically without Javascript, what you saw is what you got. Content can now
          change on the page, showing new content, or tracking changes and interactions behind the scenes. HTML is the
          a very blunt person give you all the information all at once. Javascript on the other hand gives you what you
          need at the time, and can lead you on a streamlined journey to complete the taks you setout to complete.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Explain control flow and loops</h1>
        <p>
          Control flow generally is the process in which the program is right, which is top to bottom, unless a function is called
          or loop is run. If a function is called, then the program will jump to the function and run the code with the content requested.
          With loops, they are not called but iterated over in order. When the program comes across a loop the comands within the loop iterated
          until the loop condition has been completed. A loop condition consists of a start and end value and between that range, there is a step
          size. The number of iterations therefore is range divided by step size.

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>
        <p>
          Arrays are simply lists of information that can be indexed with number [0] would be the first value, [0][2] would be the first row second column.
          An object is similar to a dictionary in python, it is a collection of keys(or parameters) with values within them. See below for examples of arrays. 
          The notation for arrays are square brackets [], and objects are donated by curly brackets {}. You can put arrays inside of objects but not the other
          way around.

        <h1 class="post-title-long"> Functions </h1>
        <p>
          Functions at their most basic, is a procedure which takes a set of inputs and produces and output. Outputs could be a value calculated, 
          task performed regarding display, tracking or request. The inputs could be an object, array or anything that can be executed upon. Below is an example
          of a function.
