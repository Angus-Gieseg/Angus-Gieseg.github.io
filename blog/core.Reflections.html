        <h1 class="post-title-long">Core Reflections </h1>
        
        <p>
          Completing the core learning helped me to retain information on a variety of 
          topics from technical to personal development. I found that I had a few gaps 
          in my understanding because I couldn’t explain some concepts simply. This was 
          good because it meant it was stored to my long term memory. The advantage of 
          storing information in my long term is when I approach a problem I can recall 
          what tools I could used from my long term memory and attack the problem head 
          on sometimes without having to review my notes. Sometimes I want to read more 
          about topics in core reflection and head down rabbit holes, consistently I was 
          under my time allocation for tech challenges and over for reflection and blogs. 
          I went overtime in reflections through curiosity and also having to review my 
          work because I am more cautious about my grammar and writing and I personally 
          dislike writing for long periods of time due to my dyslexia.
        </p>
        

        <h1 class="post-title-long">What are three new things you have learnt about 
          yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
        <p>
          I’m often very harsh on my writing abilities and conscious of them. I really 
          make it clear that I struggle with these things and want my employers to 
          understand my strengths because theres often a pre-misconception about dyslexia 
          and my strengths and weaknesses. My strengths are in technical maths, logic, 
          and systems. I love being creative and find it easy to empathise with people or 
          read a room, if you asked me to write about it I would hate it.
        </p>
        <div>   

        <h1 class="post-title-long">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness 
          in learning and programming?</h1>
        <p>
          Having empathy is important for yourself and others, there are many times where 
          you may need help or you need to help others, know how to ask for help, how not to 
          be hard on yourself is important. When your designing application for others its 
          also be empathic to your users, they may have disabilities or you may have designed 
          a solution that you believe will solve the problem, but if you don’t empathise with 
          your users it will not solve their problem.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p>
          How hard I often find it to write reflectively and talk about my experiences.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h1>
        <p>
          Editing my work and make sure I had answered the question through my reflection.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much 
          time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
        <p>
          Because there is a problem with many graduate programmers who have been trained to memories 
          technology and systems but failing to build strong habits around learning and problem solving. 
          If we leave this course with the skills to learn and the confidence to break down problems, 
          and work with others we can take on much larger and complex problems. Having a stronger set 
          of core skills, we also gain an ability to work in a team and our peers will enjoy working with us.
        </p>

        <h1 class="post-title-long">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a 
          waste of time?</h1>
        <p>
          Not at all, I found it difficult but I have become better and writting reflectively and found 
          solice is reflecting on my own personal life. Instead of going from experience to experience 
          I have become more objective about going into experiences and relfecting for the next one.
