        <h1 class="post-title">Origins</h1>
        <p>
          My origins begin is christchurch in a quant black house 
          down a coldesac near the university. Both my parents
          love to tinker, dad, a lecturer at the 
          University loves wood working and gardening while my 
          mother a radiologist spent a great deal of time in the 
          sewing room. Their creativity, curiosity and strong 
          opinions created two very chaotic and rebellious 
          children, made worse by their sprinkling of Dyslexia 
          and ADHD.  My bother now works as a Quantity Surveyor 
          and is obsessed with F1, History & Classics, and Skiing. 
          Unlikely most people I wont delve into my Highschool, 
          I was pretty reserved and most thankfully for the great 
          fellas from the school who are still with me. University 
          I launched a homebrewing society, becoming UCSA’s public 
          enemy 1#, before transitioning to trying startups and 
          taking the lead role for the student led startup society.

        <h1 class="post-title">Passions</h1>
        <p>
          My hobbies and passions often 
          change, and I’m always trying new things. When I’ve got 
          the money, I love getting up the slopes going to live 
          concerts or checking in with close friends. One passion, 
          I never thought would stick is Salsa which I’ve ended up 
          really enjoying due to the social nature, and it being 
          an alien experience to my day to day. For fitness I 
          kickbox because it keeps my mind engaged and a regular 
          gym is too monotinous.
